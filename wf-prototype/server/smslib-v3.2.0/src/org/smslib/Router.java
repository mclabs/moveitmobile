 * Base message routing class. Service owns instance of Router (or its
 * subclass), and uses its member functions to designate gateway(s) to send
 * particular outgoing message. It is allowed that router designates more than
 * modem to send message. It is responsibility of Router to decide which gateway
 * will send the message. Custom routing rules are possible by creating
 * subclass.
